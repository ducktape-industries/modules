//! Every kind a view may ask its host for, with the request and reply each
//! carries. This is the ONE list: a view names a method by its type, the host
//! answers by the same type, and a kind that is not here is a compile error
//! on one side and `unknown_request` on the other. [`ALL`] is what a host
//! test checks its handlers against.
//!
//! THE CODEC RULE. Two layers cross the guest boundary and they want
//! opposite things. The tree a view draws (`Frame`, [`WidgetCommand`]) must
//! tolerate a hundred optional fields and is decoded under a budget — that
//! is named MessagePack, in `codec`. Everything a method carries is DATA: the
//! bytes a program signs, stores or answers with, where the same value must
//! be the same bytes and an unknown field is a fault. That is borsh, the
//! codec the program abi is written in, so a program's own request rides a
//! method with no second encoding around it. The rule is held by types, not
//! by review: [`Method`] is sealed, so a view cannot declare a kind or pick a
//! codec, and [`Module`]'s bounds are borsh, so a program that speaks
//! anything else does not have a method.
//!
//! ABSENT is `None`, never a refusal: a method whose thing may not exist replies `Option`, and a refusal means the ask itself failed.
