//! Typed identity: the path a node is filed under, and when two collide.
//!
//! One rule, run by everything that walks a tree. The guest's lowering,
//! the host's renderer and its walks file every node by it ([`segment`],
//! [`row`]), so a path means one node on both sides. Whether two nodes
//! meet is the host's to say, since the guest is not trusted: its
//! sanitizer claims every id ([`Scopes`]) and refuses a frame that claims
//! one twice, naming the id and its scope. A view's tests run that same
//! sanitizer on every frame, so a duplicate fails its test in those words.
//!
//! - An id is unique among the identified nodes under its nearest
//!   identified ancestor, as gpui's `GlobalElementId` is: an id-less
//!   wrapper is transparent, an identified node starts a fresh scope.
//! - A list ([`Node::List`], [`Node::UniformList`]) is a scope of its own,
//!   under the id its author gave it: two lists under one parent are told
//!   apart by their ids, and a path through a list names it.
//! - A row of a list ([`Node::List`], [`Node::UniformList`]) is filed under
//!   its own id, or else under its index ([`row`]): the id `.id(index)`
//!   would give it. Its ids are scoped under the row, so two rows that
//!   author the same id inside them do not collide. A row named by its own
//!   id keeps that name wherever it moves; an id-less row is its place.
//!
//! Why a duplicate is refused rather than drawn: gpui files a node's
//! accessibility node by the hash of its `GlobalElementId`
//! (`GlobalElementId::accesskit_node_id`), and a second node under one id
//! is dropped from the accessibility tree with its subtree (a debug build
//! asserts "Duplicate a11y node id"); the two also share every piece of
//! gpui element state kept under that id (hover, scroll, focus). Taking
//! either one silently is the bug, so neither is.
