# Forge replay fixtures

`replies.bin` is every reply back to back; `replies.idx` says, one line per
shape, `name offset len request-hex sha256` — the request is the borsh `Query`
or `Op` that produced the bytes. `loader.rs` reads both and is shared by
`#[path]` with forge-view's tests. The bytes are what the module answered over
`guest::MockHost` in `tests/fixtures.rs`, which is what `forge.wasm` answers over
the host: same code, same bytes (checked once against the wasm-on-runtime
harness captures when the generator moved here). Three shapes carry git's own
framing, not borsh; a refusal is the borsh `abi::Refusal` (`guest::Error`, the same bytes) the module answered
`Err` with, as the host hands it to a view.

Regenerate with `FORGE_REGENERATE_FIXTURES=1 cargo test -p forge --test
fixtures`; without the variable the test must reproduce the committed bytes.
