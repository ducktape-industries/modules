//! forge: a git server as a ducktape module, `gitcore` (objects, packs,
//! walks, diffs, the wire) over `store`. The [`Forge`] module runs natively
//! over `guest::MockHost` (tests, fixtures); the `module` feature adds its
//! wasm exports.
//!
//! A write is an [`Op`] run as a [`Principal`] (an account: the signer the
//! host resolved, [`ExecCtx::sender`](guest::ExecCtx::sender), which refuses a
//! key that holds none), a read
//! a [`Query`] answered by a [`Reply`]. The layout, in reading order:
//!
//! - `contract.rs`, `read_contract.rs`, `review_contract.rs`: the wire
//! - `program.rs`: [`Forge`], the module: the signer resolved, then one
//!   match over every op and one over every query
//! - `state.rs`: every table and index, declared once
//! - `ops.rs`: the repository ops; `changes.rs` the change ops
//! - `queries.rs`, `reads.rs`, `diffs.rs`, `change_queries.rs`: the answers
//!   to its repository, object and change questions
//! - `objects.rs`: git objects over the store's blobs
//! - `discussion.rs`: what forge asks of and posts into chat
//! - `description.rs`: [`describe()`], an op in a person's words

// The wire, as a view and a git client see it.
